# Classtrail
Repository for my project ClassTrail.

My Final Year Project completed on 15/4/21, imported from an old GitHub account.

This project is a fully deployed web application utilising the Django framework, PostgreSQL, AWS and
Heroku.

ClassTrail aims to familiarise students with eportfolios by providing an easy-to-use and convenient
platform to keep a record of their work, while also allowing teachers to assign work, view uploads
and grade work.


## Design

I followed the SCRUM framework for Agile. This was essential as a feature-driven development approach was
followed. I chose this model as it helps maintain focus on work presently being done, minimises risk, 
and focuses on constant feedback for requirements.

Sprints were organised using a Trello Board by creating tasks and assigning them into 
sprints that last for two weeks each.

I designed the high level architecture of the system based on the Django architecture, which is based on the MVT pattern.
